# bearingcapacity
VBA functions for bearing capacity calculations of shallow footings

the xlsm-template is a stable assembly with the required code implemented as modules and two standard worksheets for simple and direct use. A third Worksheet gives a brief overview on the customized usage.

For revision control the VBA-code separately stored in  \Modules\ as .bas files prior to commit.
There is no revision control on the layout and the samples in the template.

Versions are hardcoded in the modules. They are tracked by git tags and follow roughly the Semantic Versioning 2.0.0 specifications (https://semver.org/). (There is no API defined...)

The geotechnical background of the calculations can be found in \Doc
